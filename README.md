# SettingsUtilsLib
### Angular Utility Libraries Workspace

This workspace centralizes reusable Angular services and utilities that can be shared across multiple projects.

## Purpose

Many Angular projects need small utilities like font management, theming, or other global logic. This workspace allows:

- Centralized, reusable services
- Modular architecture with independent versioning
- Easy installation via npm
- Consistent utilities across projects

## Current Libraries

- [settings-utils](https://github.com/Greezaaa/settings-utils-lib/blob/main/projects/settings-utils/README.md) â€” Provides shared services for font sizing, theming, and other global utilities.

## Installation

Install the package in your project with:
```
  npm install settings-utils
```

## Why This Workspace

Having a dedicated workspace for utilities helps:

1. Avoid duplicating code across projects
2. Easily update and propagate changes via npm
3. Maintain clear versioning
4. Encourage modular and maintainable architecture

## Contributing

- Keep libraries modular
- Document services clearly
- Version packages with `npm version`
- Write unit tests where applicable
