### Angular Utility Libraries Workspace

This workspace centralizes reusable Angular services and utilities that can be shared across multiple projects.

## Purpose

Many Angular projects need small utilities like font management, theming, or other global logic. This workspace allows:

- Centralized, reusable services
- Modular architecture with independent versioning
- Easy installation via npm
- Consistent utilities across projects

## Current Libraries

* [**@su-labs/font-size**](https://github.com/Greezaaa/settings-utils-lib/blob/main/projects/su-labs/font-size/README.md) â€” A lightweight Angular service for dynamic font size management.
* [**@su-labs/notifications**](https://github.com/Greezaaa/settings-utils-lib/blob/main/projects/su-labs/notifications/README.md) â€” A highly customizable Angular notification library built with modern practices, including reactive Signals.
* [**@su-labs/scroll-spy**](https://github.com/Greezaaa/settings-utils-lib/blob/main/projects/su-labs/scroll-spy/README.md) â€” A lightweight Angular service and directive for creating scroll-based navigation and highlighting active sections.
* [**@su-labs/visit-tracker**](https://github.com/Greezaaa/settings-utils-lib/blob/main/projects/su-labs/visit-tracker/README.md) â€” A lightweight Angular service to track user visits and milestones.
* [**@su-labs/theme**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@su-labs/theme) â€” A robust and reactive Angular service for managing application themes. It provides a full-featured solution that supports dynamic switching, user preference persistence, and automatic system theme detection.

## Why This Workspace

Having a dedicated workspace for utilities helps:

1. Avoid duplicating code across projects
2. Easily update and propagate changes via npm
3. Maintain clear versioning
4. Encourage modular and maintainable architecture

## Contributing
